# The 'Challenge the Map' project

A plan called "Internet for All," from the the Biden-Harris Administration, presents a plan to fund and implement the deployment of High-Speed Internet nationwide. On November 18th, the FCC reveals a "Broadband Internet map" displaying the broadband coverage of the United States. The team from [civichacker.com](https://civichacker.com) thinks we can collective create the code and data to improve the broadband maps to ensure everyone has access to affordable Internet service.


The goals of "Challenge the Map" are to:
- Promote awareness of the National Broadband Map and any avenues to obtain affordable Internet service.
- Create software that help public and private entities (e.g., Fabric licensees) submit challenges to the FCC.
- Encourage individuals to submit challenges using the FCC's Speed Test mobile app.
- Submit one or more bulk challenges to the Federal Communications Commission.
