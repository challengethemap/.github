A plan called "Internet for All," from the the Biden-Harris Administration, presents a plan to fund and implement the deployment of High-Speed Internet nationwide.
On November 18th, the FCC reveals a "Broadband Internet map" displaying the broadband coverage of the US.
Between November 18th & January 13th, they're welcoming challenges to their map to ensure everyone gets included.

The goals of "Challenge the Map" are to:
- Display the current broadband map from the FCC
- provide people with a way to submit challenges to the FCC map if they find they're being excluded.
- If all goes well, we'll submit a "bulk challenge" to the Federal government to ensure their communities are included in the High-speed Internet rollout.
